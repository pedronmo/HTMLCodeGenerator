About Code Generator

This little tool came from a need that I have since the dawn of times. Every time I'm starting a project, using HTML frameworks or not, I have to repeat the same steps, type in the doctype I need, tipe every metadata field, download frameworks, etc. etc.

With this tool all that steps are reduced to a simpler task: a couple of clicks in the same place. Hope you enjoy it.

 
W3C Validation

Code Generator respects all the w3c rules and recomendations so you don't have to worry about that when choosing from diferent doctypes.
